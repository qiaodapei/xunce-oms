</p>

<p>

If Licensee fails to pay License Fees or Software Support and Upgrades Fees by their due date, without limitation of other rights and remedies, at Zend's request, Licensee shall pay late charges of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, together with all of Zend's expenses and collection costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in enforcing the Agreement.

In addition, Zend may immediately terminate this Agreement, including all license rights granted herein, in the event Licensee breaches any of its confidentiality obligations herein.

Licensee's obligation in this Section 7 shall be relieved by Zend's failure to promptly notify Licensee of a claim only to the extent that Licensee is materially prejudiced by such failure.<br />In no event shall Licensee settle any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding in any manner that materially prejudices Zend's rights without Zend's prior written approval.<br />
